3. As a user, I want to be able to see all works alphabetically by name.
4. As a user, I want to see all works in order by creation date.
5. As a user, I want to be able to see links on the homepage to the most popular filtered lists (for example: subgenres, dates)
6. As a user, I want to be able to view a featured work on the home page that randomly changes each time I visit.
7. As a user, I want to be able to view each work individually to see all of its details.
